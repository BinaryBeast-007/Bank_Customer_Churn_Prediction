## Introduction

This Jupyter Notebook project aims to predict customer churn in a bank using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. In the context of a bank, customer churn occurs when clients close their accounts or switch to another bank.

The project utilizes a dataset containing various features related to bank customers, such as account balance, credit score, number of products held, and more. By building and training machine learning models on this dataset, the project aims to predict whether a customer is likely to churn.

## Prerequisites

To run this Jupyter Notebook project, you need the following prerequisites:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Notebook Overview

The Jupyter Notebook is structured as follows:

1) Introduction: Brief overview of the project and its goals.
2) Data Preprocessing: Loading and exploring the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data 
   into training and testing sets.
3) Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing the distribution of features, exploring correlations, and identifying patterns in the data.
4) Model Building: Implementing and training various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient 
   Boosting.
5) Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Comparing model results.
6) Conclusion: Summarizing the findings, discussing insights, and suggesting potential actions based on the predictions.
   Results

## Results

The analysis and machine learning models provide insights into the factors that contribute to customer churn in a bank. The models' performance metrics help in selecting the most suitable model for making accurate predictions. Visualizations and graphs assist in understanding data distributions and correlations.
